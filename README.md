This is a frequency based skeleton-model of a word autocompletion-system, done in collaboration with Asadullah (ID: Asadniz). The system has been implemented with AVL trees in python. Prefix-match and frequency count have been used as the filtering method. Contributions can be added to add more filter methods and make the code more efficient.
